# HCGplugin

PaperMC 1.21.x & 26.x plugin split into a **base plugin** plus **installable feature addons**. The base
provides the `/hcg` help menu and the always-on Admin, Item, and World commands; each game mode or
feature (Health Decay, Lava Raise, NPCs, ...) ships as its own addon JAR that depends on the base.
Install only the addons you want. All commands default to op-only.

| Addon | What it adds | Commands |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`HCGplugin-HealthDecay`](addons/healthdecay/README.md) | Health decay game mode | `/healthdecay` |
| [`HCGplugin-RandomDrops`](addons/randomdrops/README.md) | Random block drops game mode | `/randomdrops` |
| [`HCGplugin-LavaRaise`](addons/lavaraise/README.md) | Rising lava event | `/lavaraise`, `/volcano` |
| [`HCGplugin-HungerGames`](addons/hungergames/README.md) | Battle-royale border game | `/hungergames` |
| [`HCGplugin-NPCs`](addons/npcs/README.md) | Packet-based player NPCs | `/npc` |
| [`HCGplugin-Graves`](addons/graves/README.md) | Death graves | `/graves` |

Each addon hard-depends on the base. Every module has its own config and messages in its own `plugins/<name>/` folder.

## Building

```
mvn package
```

This is a multi-module Maven build (requires JDK 21). Every module's JAR is collected into a
`dist/` folder at the repo root (each module also keeps its own copy under `target/`):

- `dist/HCGplugin-<version>.jar` (base)
- `dist/HCGplugin-<Feature>-<version>.jar` (one per addon)

Drop `HCGplugin-<version>.jar` into your server's `plugins/` folder (it is required), then add
whichever addon JARs you want, and restart. To build a single addon and the base only:
`mvn -pl addons/lavaraise -am package`.

## Help

`/hcg help` or `/hcg` shows the clickable category list.
Click a category or type `/hcg help <category> [page]` to see its commands, paginated with Back/Prev/Next arrows and click-to-fill command entries. Category names are matched loosely: `/hcg help admin` works.

## Base commands

These ship with the base `HCGplugin` and are always available. The game modes and other features live
in the addon docs linked under [Modules](#modules) above.
